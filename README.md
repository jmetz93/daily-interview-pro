# daily-interview-pro

Signed up for Daily Interview Pro and now receive an algorithm problem every morning. Storing them here with their solutions as I complete them. 
If you want to try the problems yourself check out the unsolved branch of the repo.  All questions done in Python as that seems to be the most universally friendly for interview challenges... 
also the problems get emailed to me set up in python. 

## Testing Your Solution

If you attempt working on these from the Unsolved branch and want to test your solution, follow these steps in the terminal

```bash
$ cd /path/to/daily-interview-pro
$ git checkout unsolved
*** after doing work on a problem ***
$ cd Problems
$ python <name-of-file>.py
```

All the files should have a test example for your solution and will print the result in the terminal. The expected result will be commented right under the print statement.
